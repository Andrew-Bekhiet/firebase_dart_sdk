I've started working on this project ready to learn and ready to provide help to others that might need my work. Since this project was way ahead of its time, and help came when it was not worth maintaining anymore, I strongly feel that anyone, that want to pickup on this huge task, should start fron scratch, since a lot of the decisions made in this project were based on what I knew then about Dart and Firebase. The only 2 beings that knew why I did certein things was me and God. Now it's only God. Please have fun reading the code and enjoy arround 2000 free hours berried in this project.
